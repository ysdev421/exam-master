# SEO and Scale Roadmap

## Priority 1 (This week)
- Add crawl/index basics: title, description, canonical, robots meta.
- Add `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml`.
- Define exam-level config (`src/config/exams.ts`) to separate shared logic from exam-specific copy.

## Priority 2 (Next 2 weeks)
- Add exam landing pages with unique URLs (`/exams/fe`, `/exams/ap`).
- Generate per-page metadata and structured data (FAQ, Breadcrumb).
- Add internal links between exam hub and category/topic pages.

## Priority 3 (Next month)
- Introduce question/explanation detail URLs for indexable long-tail pages.
- Add content update workflow by exam cycle and Search Console query-based rewrites.
- Expand `exams.ts` with AP and cloud certs after FE baseline metrics are stable.

## KPI (track weekly)
- Indexed pages count
- Query impressions/clicks (Search Console)
- Top landing page CTR
- Returning learners from organic search
